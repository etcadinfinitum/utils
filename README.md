# utils
Handy utilities (centralized here instead of across gists/no version control)

## Deploy

0. Install `git` on your machine.
1. Clone this repository on your machine.
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/etcadinfinitum/utils.git
```
2. Cherry-pick your preferred configs or utility scripts. For a fresh OS 
   installation, you can use `new_setup.sh` to get most essential software 
   installed, as well as the author's preferred `vim` plugins. _NOTE: 
   YCM support out of the box is still a WIP._
